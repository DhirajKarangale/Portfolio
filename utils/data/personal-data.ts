I focus on modern frontend development with React (Hooks, Redux Toolkit, React Query) and create clean, user-friendly UIs using Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Bootstrap. On the backend, I build robust REST APIs, implement secure authentication with JWT, and work efficiently with both NoSQL and SQL databases.
I have working knowledge of Java for backend systems, and strong problem-solving skills. As a HackWithInfy Finalist, I emphasize performance and code quality. I've also developed apps with a combined total of 160K+ downloads on the Play Store, showcasing my ability to deliver real-world, high-impact solutions.`,
