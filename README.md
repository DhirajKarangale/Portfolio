# Dhiraj Karangale
**Full-Stack Engineer · Backend Systems · AI Infrastructure**

I build **production-grade systems**, not demos.

My work spans frontend architecture, backend APIs, real-time systems, and AI-powered pipelines. I focus on **clarity, performance, and reliability**, and I prefer shipping software that runs continuously in real environments.

## About

I’m a **Full-Stack Engineer with 1.5+ years of production experience**, currently working at **Infosys**.

I work end-to-end across:
- UI architecture & UX polish  
- Backend APIs & data modeling  
- Caching, real-time pipelines, and infrastructure  
- AI & retrieval-augmented systems  

I care about **clean abstractions, predictable behavior, and systems that scale beyond localhost**.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This portfolio is intentionally minimal.

It’s designed to demonstrate:
- How I structure real systems  
- How I reason about correctness & performance  
- How I ship and maintain software  
- How I balance UX with engineering constraints  

You’ll find **fewer projects, but deeper ones** — each built to solve a real problem properly.
